# NMAT Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of National Medical Admission Test (NMAT) performance data from 2006-2018, offering policy-oriented insights into medical education admission patterns and trends.

## Key Insights and Findings

### 📈 Performance Trends (2006-2018)
- **Stable Performance**: Median percentile ranks remain remarkably consistent around 43-44% across the study period
- **Score Distribution**: Total raw scores show minimal variation, with medians ranging from 3,900-3,950 points
- **Component Balance**: Part I (Aptitude) and Part II (Science) scores maintain consistent proportions
- **Enrollment Patterns**: Examinee numbers show slight fluctuations but remain stable overall

### ⚖️ Score Stability Analysis
- **Distribution Consistency**: Box plots reveal stable score distributions across years
- **IQR Analysis**: Interquartile ranges demonstrate consistent performance spread
- **No Significant Shifts**: Kruskal-Wallis tests confirm distributional stability over time

### 📊 Decile-Based Distribution Analysis
- **Theoretical Alignment**: Most deciles align closely with expected 10% distributions
- **Top Performance**: D8-D10 deciles show slight variations from theoretical 30%
- **Policy Implications**: Distribution patterns inform admission policy effectiveness

### 🏫 University Type Analysis
- **Public Dominance**: Public universities represent 79% of examinees
- **Foreign Performance**: Foreign examinees (1.7% of total) show distinct performance patterns
- **Median Differences**: Significant performance variations across university types

### 🎓 Course Background Analysis
- **Medical Focus**: Medical & Allied courses dominate (48% of examinees)
- **Performance Patterns**: Natural Sciences show strong performance alignment
- **Statistical Significance**: Mann-Whitney tests reveal significant course-based differences

### 🏥 PLE Integration Analysis
- **High Match Rate**: 99.97% successful integration with Physician Licensure Examination data
- **Performance Correlation**: PLE-matched examinees show slightly higher median performance
- **Data Quality**: Exceptional matching quality enables comprehensive pathway analysis

### 🔀 Flow Visualizations
- **University Pathways**: Sankey diagrams illustrate performance flows from university types to deciles
- **Course Trajectories**: Visual pathways from pre-med backgrounds to performance outcomes
- **PLE Status Flows**: Decile-to-PLE match status transitions
